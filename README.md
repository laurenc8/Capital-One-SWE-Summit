# Capital-One-SWE-Summit

While this site is available at https://laurenc8.github.io/Capital-One-SWE-Summit/, it is not functional because it uses a developer API key, which only allows requests from localhost. To see the app in action, clone the repository, and run `npm install; npm run start` to start a local development server.

NewsGUI is a minimal web application that allows users to search for news articles in entertainment, sports, and technology. Instead of telling you the things it has, I'll tell you what it doesn't have--no logins, no tracking, no algorithm. Just the news you search for, in chronological order as returned by newsAPI.
