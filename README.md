# Capital-One-SWE-Summit

While this site is available at https://laurenc8.github.io/Capital-One-SWE-Summit/, it is not functional because it uses a developer API key, which only allows requests from localhost. To see the app in action, clone the repo, and run `npm install; npm run start` to start a local development server.
